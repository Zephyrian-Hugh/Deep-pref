# Script to stop vLLM servers - Ultimate Version (based on process groups)
#
# Core principle:
# 1. Find the main process PID by listening port number.
# 2. Find the process group ID (PGID) from the main process PID.
# 3. Use `kill -- -<PGID>` to send signals to the entire process group,
#    which will kill all processes (parent, child, grandchild...) in the group.
